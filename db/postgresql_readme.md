# Instructions for PostgreSQL installation

# Install postgreSQL using brew
brew install postgresql

# Install postgres module for node.js
npm install -g pg

# To start the DB, run this command:
brew services start postgresql

# Check to see if you have postgres user
In terminal, type psql to enter postgres CLI
Check your users by typing \du to see existing users

If you do not have a user named postgres, follow instructions laid out in article above

# Create the rentopia database
in psql, run this query:
CREATE DATABASE rentopia;

then type \q

# Create all the tables in the db
From Sublime, get the filepath of the createdb.sql file in the db folder
In terminal now, run the following command:
psql rentopia < [insert file path]
Example: [psql rentopia < /Users/BChilds/Desktop/PropMan/db/createdb.sql]

# Set environment variables, as seen on this page: [https://node-postgres.com/features/connecting]
I ended up putting PGUSER, PGDATABASE and PGPASSWORD in my .bash_profile to always run for every terminal. PGUSER should be postgres, PGPASSWORD is the password you set for that user, and PGDATABASE is rentopia
